# Boggle

A project I've been working on for my Object Oriented Programming in Java class. Create a Boggle game in Java.

So far we have...

1. Adding member variables or instance variable in a class 
2. Generating getters/setters for member variables 
3. Instantiating an instance of a class 
4. Calling a method of a class using the reference object 
5. Using Java API class ArrayList
6. Reading a data file
a. Using a try/catch/finally block to handle exceptions and close resource files
i. IOException 
ii. URISyntaxException 
b. Using Java API class Scanner
c. Using Java API class URL
d. Using Java API class File
7. Saving data from a data file in an ArrayList
8. Adding method signatures to an interface 
9. Adding a constant to an interface 
10. Implementing an interface 
11. Using the enhanced for loop
